## About the Database

The project uses an **SQLite database** to store all the book information. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that doesn't require any additional setup. Here's how the database works in this project:

### Database File
- The database is stored in a file named `library.db`.
- This file is automatically created when you run the script for the first time.

### Database Table
- The database contains a single table named `books`.
- The table has the following columns:
  1. **`id`**: A unique 3-digit ID for each book (automatically generated).
  2. **`title`**: The title of the book.
  3. **`author`**: The author of the book.
  4. **`year`**: The publication year of the book.
  5. **`genre`**: The genre of the book.
  6. **`content`**: A description or summary of the book.
  7. **`read`**: A boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the book has been read.

### How the Database is Created
- When you run the script for the first time, the `init_database()` function is called.
- This function creates the `books` table if it doesn't already exist.

## Steps to Create the Database (For Beginners)

If you're new to databases, don't worry! Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding how the database works in this project:

1. **What is a Database?**
   - A database is like a digital filing cabinet where you can store and organize data.
   - In this project, the database stores information about your books.

2. **What is SQLite?**
   - SQLite is a simple, file-based database system.
   - It doesn't require any setup or installation because it's included with Python.

3. **How is the Database Created?**
   - When you run the script, the `init_database()` function is executed.
   - This function creates a file named `library.db` (if it doesn't exist) and sets up the `books` table.

4. **How is Data Stored?**
   - Each book is stored as a row in the `books` table.
   - The columns in the table represent different attributes of the book (e.g., title, author, year).

5. **How is Data Retrieved?**
   - When you search for a book or display all books, the script queries the database to retrieve the relevant data.

## Example Workflow

1. **Add a Book**:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py add
   ```
   Enter the book details when prompted.

2. **Display All Books**:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py display
   ```
   View the list of all books in your library.

3. **Search for a Book**:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py search
   ```
   Search for a book by title, author, or ID.

4. **Remove a Book**:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py remove
   ```
   Remove a book by entering its ID.

5. **View Statistics**:
   ```bash
   python library_manager.py stats
   ```
   View the total number of books and the percentage of books you've read.

## Troubleshooting

- **Database Errors**: If you encounter errors related to the database, make sure the `library.db` file is not corrupted. You can delete the file and run the script again to create a new database.
- **Command Not Working**: Ensure you're using the correct command and that Python is installed correctly.
